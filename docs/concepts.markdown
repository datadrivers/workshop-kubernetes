# Concepts

Before the course really gets going, there are a few important concepts to clarify.

1. Declarative > imperative: State your desired results, let the system actuate
2. Control loops: Observe, rectify, repeat
3. Simple > Complex: Try to do as little as possible
4. Modularity: Components, interfaces, & plugins
5. Legacy compatible: Requiring apps to change is a non-starter
7. No grouping: Labels are the only groups
9. Open > Closed: Open Source, standards, REST, JSON, etc.
