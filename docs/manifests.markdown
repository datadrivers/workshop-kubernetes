## Describing a Kubernetes object

When you create an object in Kubernetes, you must provide the object spec that describes its desired state, as well as some basic information about the object (such as a name). When you use the Kubernetes API to create the object (either directly or via kubectl), that API request must include that information as JSON in the request body. Most often, you provide the information to kubectl in a .yaml file. kubectl converts the information to JSON when making the API request.

Here's an example .yaml file that shows the required fields and object spec for a Kubernetes Deployment:

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Required fields

In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:

- apiVersion - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
- kind - What kind of object you want to create
- metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
- spec - What state you desire for the object

## Object spec and status

Almost every Kubernetes object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object `spec` and the object `status`.

### Spec

For objects that have a `spec`, you have to set this when you create the object, providing a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its desired state.

### Status

The `status` describes the current state of the object, supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system and its components. The Kubernetes control plane continually and actively manages every object's actual state to match the desired state you supplied.

For example: in Kubernetes, a Deployment is an object that can represent an application running on your cluster. When you create the Deployment, you might set the Deployment spec to specify that you want three replicas of the application to be running. The Kubernetes system reads the Deployment spec and starts three instances of your desired application--updating the status to match your spec. If any of those instances should fail (a status change), the Kubernetes system responds to the difference between spec and status by making a correction--in this case, starting a replacement instance.

For more information on the object spec, status, and metadata, see the Kubernetes API Conventions.
